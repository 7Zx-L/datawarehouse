\maketitle

\#\#Question 1 Both fact table and star schema are very inportant for
organizing and structuring data for analyzing. Fact table could used to
store quantitative data which are generally numeric. Each row could
represent a specific event, and each column could represent an attribute
related to the event.The fact table could also includes foreign keys
reference to dimension tables. Each dimension table is connected to the
fact table through a foreign key, and the data will be easier to
aggregate and analyze for multidimensional analysis. Star schema could
be used to design a data warehouse, and it's optimized for OLAP queries.
The fact table is at the center of the schema and surrounded by some
dimension tables. The query will be simplified and become faster. I
think transactional database could be used for OLAP, but generally it
might not be a good choice to use it for OLAP. Transactional database is
optimized for fast update, insertion and so on, and is very useful for
OLTP cause OLTP requires reaction to real-time transactional data. Cause
transactional database is not optimized for complex analytical problems,
it may not performing well. Also, the transactional database is
generally normalized and the speed of query might be slower.

\#\#Qeusion 2 Data warehouse is a centralized repository that stores
historical and structured data for enterprise-wide reporting and
analysis. Data mart is the subset of data warehouse, and it could
provide specialized data under specific condition. Data lake is a vast
and relative flexible storage repository which stores both structured
and unstructured data. The data structure will be stored in its raw
format, which enables the exploration and analyzaion of diverse data
types. Example of data warehouse: Healthcare organization could use a
data warehouse to store large amount of data including the billing
system, health records, patient feedback and so on. Data could be used
to make decisions and imporve the caring ability. Data warehouse could
porvide a comprehensive view of many aspects of the healthcare
organization. Example of data mart: data mart could provide efficient
access to data and facilitate the decision-making process. Like the data
mart for human resources, it could contain information like employee
information, performence, satisfaction level and so on. By using this
data mart, human resource could make some strategies and decisions.
Example of data lake: The flexibility of data lake allows organizations
process large amounts of data from diverse source. By analyzing the data
of customers, the customers could be classified into different groups
based on their behavior, preference and so on. This could help target
the potential customers, and provide personalize product. An article
about the differences is shown in the following website

\#\#Question 3 I hope to track under what condition, the flights and
birds strike. I also want to know some details about both the flight,
the airport and the birds. To find out the background of the stike, I
need to know the date the strike happened, and also under what condition
it happened. The condition should contain both the weather condition and
the flying condition. Also, where did the strike happened is also
important. I also need to include the details of the flights and birds
to make the record of the strike complete.
